	<h1>BLUE APRON PROMOS ARE NOT "FREE FOOD"</h1>
</header>


<p>
	Dear Podcaster,<br/>
<br/>
  Like so many others before you, you've chosen to sell advertising time to the mail order meal service Blue Apron. Ok. I get it. You've got to pay the bills like anyone else, and Blue Apron seems like a fairly innocuous, apolitical, helpful little service. Plus, they give you a nifty promo code you can offer your listeners as a thanks. Fair enough. <br/>
<br/>
  The problem is not THAT you promote Blue Apron, but rather HOW you promote Blue Apron. Despite the fact that many of you claim to have tried the service yourselves, you seem to misunderstand the pricing model and how the promo fits into that model. As a result, too often you declare the "three free meals" promotion to be totally free food--how could anyone say no to that?<br/>
<br/>
  Let's take a moment to see exactly what "three free meals" at Blue Apron will cost.<br/>
</p>

<p>
  Here we have Blue Apron's pricing breakdown for their various plans. The most important thing to take note of here is the concept of <b>servings</b>. The 2-person plan offers three meals per week, with two servings in each meal. That means a total of six <b>servings</b> at $9.99 each, for a total price of $59.94. Family plans offer four servings per meal with small discount on the per-serving price, but strangely offer only 2 or 4 meals per week, while the smaller plan only offers 3 meals per week. Let's go over some of these terms one more time, for clarity.</p>

  <p class="special">
     MEAL = while the term "meal" is not explicitly used in Blue Apron's price breakdown, it is used in the general description of each plan, as in "seasonally-inspired meals" or "family-style meals" with the implication that a "meal" is made up of one recipe and multiple servings.<br/>
     <br/>
     RECIPE = Blue Apron's more specific term for what might otherwise be understood as a "meal"; each pricing plan consists of a set number of "recipes" per week, with each recipe serving 2 or 4 people depending upon the plan selected.<br/>
     <br/>
     SERVING = servings indicate how many people each recipe serves; each recipe in the 2-person plan includes 2 servings, each recipe in the family plan includes 4 servings.
</p>
<p>
  Here's where the confusion comes in: Blue Apron's ubiquitous promo codes offer three (sometimes even four!) free "meals". The term "meal" is somewhat ambiguous for Blue Apron, but the more common understanding is essentially what Blue Apron calls a "recipe". However, the actual terms of this promotion are not three free <b>recipes</b>, but rather three free <b>servings</b>. Since the smallest number of <b>servings</b> one can purchase from Blue Apron is six (three recipes with two servings each), this brings me to my ultimate point.</p>
<br/>

  <b>A PROMOTION ADVERTISING THREE--OR EVEN FOUR--FREE MEALS AT BLUE APRON WILL STILL REQUIRE A PURCHASE.</b></p>

<br/>
<p>As you can see in the image above, the "three free meals" promo has been applied as a $30 discount, since I have selected the 2-person plan that costs $9.99 per serving. Thus, I have recieved a discount of three free <b>servings</b> out of a total six. This leaves my remaining cost as $29.94. What's more, Blue Apron is a weekly subscription service, so by using this promo I have also signed up to recieve weekly deliveries for $59.94 per week, after the first-week price of $29.94. <br/>
  <br/>
Look. I'm not saying this is a scam; I'm not even saying it's a bad deal. If someone is considering trying Blue Apron's service, this promo is a decent way to give it a try without sinking a whole $60 into an unknown. But when I hear perfectly well-intentioned podcasters go on and on about "who wouldn't want free food?" I just have to take a stand. This is a fairly pricey service to begin with, and while I'm sure there are people for whom it is entirely worth the price, it's undeniable that your dollar will stretch an awful lot futher with a quick trip to the grocey store and a scan of some free recipes on the internet. So go ahead and do your 30-second spot for Blue Apron; talk about their interesting recipes and how nice it is to have everything conveniently prepped and ready with no excess (disclaimer: I have not actually used the service but those seem like they are probably some it's strong points). Just DON'T use the price--with or without the promo--as your big sell. It's misleading, confusing, and feels uncomfortably disingenuous coming from a podcaster your audience has come to know and trust. You can do better.<br/>
